## Functional

- [Accelerate](https://github.com/AccelerateHS/accelerate) - Embedded language for high-performance array computations.
- [Agda](https://github.com/agda/agda) - Dependently typed functional language.
- [Alice ML](https://github.com/aliceml/aliceml) - Functional programming language based on Standard ML, extended with support for concurrent, distributed, and constraint programming.
- [Amulet](https://github.com/tmpim/amulet) - Simple functional programming language in the ML tradition, with support for higher-rank parametric polymorphic types and row-polymorphic records, pattern matching with algebraic data types, and tail recursion elimination.
- [Eff](http://www.eff-lang.org/) - Functional language with handlers of not only exceptions, but also of other computational effects such as state or I/O.
- [Eta](https://github.com/typelead/eta) - Dialect of Haskell on the JVM.
- [Eve](https://github.com/witheve/Eve) - Programming language based on years of research into building a human-first programming platform.
- [F\*](https://fstar-lang.org/#introduction) - General-purpose functional programming language with effects aimed at program verification.
- [Flix](https://github.com/flix/flix) - Statically typed functional- and logic programming language inspired by Scala, OCaml, F#, Haskell, and Datalog.
- [Futhark](https://github.com/diku-dk/futhark) - Purely functional data-parallel programming language. Its optimising compiler is able to compile it to typically very performant GPU code.
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) - Advanced, purely functional programming language.
- [Ocaml](https://ocaml.org/) - Industrial strength language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles.
- [Sixten](https://github.com/ollef/sixten) - Experimental functional language where all data is unboxed by default. Functional programming with fewer indirections.
- [TiML](http://adam.chlipala.net/papers/TimlOOPSLA17/) - Functional Language for Practical Complexity Analysis with Invariants.
- [Unison](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison) - Modern, statically-typed purely functional language, similar to Haskell, but with a unique ability to describe entire distributed systems with a single program.
- [Expresso](https://github.com/willtim/Expresso) - Simple expressions language with polymorphic extensible row types.
- [Bosatsu](https://github.com/johnynek/bosatsu) - Python-ish pure and total functional programming language.
- [Silt](https://github.com/silt-lang/silt) - An in-progress fast, dependently typed, functional programming language implemented in Swift.
- [Granule](https://github.com/granule-project/granule) - Statically typed functional language with graded modal types for fine-grained program reasoning via types.
- [LinearML](https://github.com/pikatchu/LinearML) - Functional language for parallel programming.
- [Koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka) - Function-oriented language with effect inference.
- [Beluga](https://github.com/Beluga-lang/Beluga) - Functional programming language designed for reasoning about formal systems.

## Lisp

- [Clojure](https://github.com/JeffBezanson/femtolisp) - Dynamic, general-purpose, combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded programming.
- [femtolisp](https://github.com/JeffBezanson/femtolisp) - Lightweight, robust, scheme-like lisp implementation.
- [Fennel](https://github.com/bakpakin/Fennel) - Lua Lisp Language.
- [PicoLisp](https://picolisp.com/wiki/) - Simple and lightweight and encourages clean, concise code.
- [Janet](https://github.com/janet-lang/janet) - Functional and imperative programming language and bytecode interpreter.

## Multi paradigm

- [C](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>) - General-purpose, imperative, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.
- [Go](https://github.com/golang/go) - Compiled, statically typed in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.
- [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe) - High-level and strictly-typed, cross-compiles to many different targets.
- [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) - High-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted.
- [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) - High-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing.
- [Objective C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) - General-purpose and object-oriented, adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.
- [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython) - Interpreted high-level language for general-purpose programming.
- [Swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) - General-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language.
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) - Strict syntactical superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language.

## Other

- [RaptorJIT](https://github.com/raptorjit/raptorjit) - Dynamic language for system programming (LuaJIT fork).
- [Zig](https://github.com/zig-lang/zig) - Robust, optimal, and clear programming language.
- [Tengo](https://github.com/d5/tengo) - Fast script language for Go.
- [Ciao](https://github.com/ciao-lang/ciao) - Programming language that builds up from a logic-based simple kernel, and is designed to be extensible and modular.
